# Parkinson Disease Prediction

Parkinson's is a neurodegenerative progressive disorder disease.It appears in the part of the brain called substantia nigra. Normally these brain cells produce dopamine and these dopamine operates in a delicate balance with other neurotransmitters to help cordinate the millions of nerve and muscle cell involved in the movement. When these nerve cells die or become impaired, they lose the ability to produce the dopamine.

## Dataset

 The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle data bank. The dataset has 24 columns, thus we need to reduce the dimension before we train the data. The target or independent variable is "status" with binary values of 0 and 1. Status values for healthy person and PD person are 0 and 1 respectively. This is a classification probelm. The goal of this project is to develope the best machine learning model to predict the Parkinson's disease so that we can treat the patient in the timely manner

This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD). Each column in the table is a particular voice measure, and each row corresponds to one of 195 voice recordings from these individuals ("name" column).
